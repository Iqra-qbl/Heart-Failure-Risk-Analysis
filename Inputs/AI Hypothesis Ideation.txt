Using Copilot to generate possible hypotheses

Q. What possible hypotheses can predict chances of heart failure based on the dataset?
A. Hypotheses to Explore:
   1. Age as a Predictor
      Hypothesis: Individuals aged 60 and above are at significantly higher risk of heart failure compared to younger individuals.
   
   2. Gender and Risk
      Hypothesis: Males are more likely to experience heart failure than females.
   
   3. Smoking Habits
      Hypothesis: Smoking is a strong predictor of heart failure, with smokers exhibiting significantly higher risks.
 
   4. Diabetes Impact
      Hypothesis: Individuals with diabetes are at greater risk of heart failure compared to non-diabetics

   5. Cholesterol Levels
      Hypothesis: High levels of cholesterol (represented by Cholesterol) are positively associated with an increased risk of heart failure.

   6. Blood Pressure
      Hypothesis: Patients with hypertension (High_BP) are at greater risk of developing heart failure than those with normal blood pressure levels.

   7. Obesity and BMI
      Hypothesis: Higher BMI (Body Mass Index) values are strongly correlated with increased risk of heart failure.

   8. Physical Activity
      Hypothesis: Individuals reporting higher physical activity levels are at a significantly lower risk of heart failure compared to sedentary individuals.

  9. Combination of Factors
     Hypothesis: The presence of two or more risk factors (e.g., Smoking, High_BP, Diabetes) dramatically increases the probability of heart failure compared to isolated risk factors.

 10. Resting Heart Rate
     Hypothesis: Individuals with elevated resting heart rates (if included in Heart Rate or related features) are more prone to heart failure.
