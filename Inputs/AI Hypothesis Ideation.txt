Using Copilot to generate possible hypotheses

Q. What possible hypotheses can predict chances of heart failure based on the dataset?
A. Hypotheses to Explore:
   1. Age as a Predictor
      Hypothesis: Individuals aged 60 and above are at significantly higher risk of heart failure compared to younger individuals.
   
   2. Gender and Risk
      Hypothesis: Males are more likely to experience heart failure than females.
   
   3. Cholesterol Levels
      Hypothesis: High levels of cholesterol (represented by Cholesterol) are positively associated with an increased risk of heart failure.

   4. Blood Pressure
      Hypothesis: Patients with higher blood pressure are at greater risk of developing heart failure than those with normal blood pressure levels.


  5. Combination of Factors
     Hypothesis: The presence of two or more risk factors and elevation of medical indicators (e.g., ECG, High_BP, Excercide Angina, Maximum heart rate)
     dramatically increases the probability of heart failure compared to isolated risk factors.
