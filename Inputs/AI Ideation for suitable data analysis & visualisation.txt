Using Copilot to find suitable data analysis and Visualisation techniques

Q. What data analysis and visualisation would be suitable?


Given the Heart Failure Prediction Dataset, hereâ€™s a breakdown of appropriate data analysis techniques and visualisation approaches tailored to the dataset and hypotheses:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To gain an initial understanding of the dataset:

Analysis:

   Summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical features like Age, Cholesterol, and RestingBP.

   Frequency counts for categorical features such as Sex, Smoking, and Diabetes.

   Correlation matrix to assess relationships between numerical variables and the target variable (HeartDisease).

Visualisations:

   Histograms: For features like Age, RestingBP, and Cholesterol to observe their distribution.

   Box plots: To identify outliers in numerical data (e.g., resting blood pressure).

   Bar charts: To compare categorical variables like Sex or Smoking with the target variable.

2. Univariate Analysis
Explore individual features and their relationship to heart disease:

Analysis:

  Calculate proportions of individuals with and without heart failure for each categorical variable.

  Perform hypothesis testing (e.g., chi-square test) to check the statistical significance of categorical variables.

Visualisations:

  Pie charts: For proportions of HeartDisease vs. No HeartDisease.

Bar plots: To show differences in heart disease prevalence by groups, e.g., smokers vs. non-smokers.

3. Bivariate Analysis
Analyze the relationship between two variables, especially predictors and the target (HeartDisease):

Analysis:

   Correlation analysis for numerical variables (e.g., Cholesterol vs. RestingBP).

   Grouped averages for categories (e.g., average cholesterol levels by Smoking status).

Visualisations:

   Scatter plots: To assess trends in continuous variables, e.g., Age vs. RestingBP.

   Stacked bar plots: To compare heart disease prevalence across categories (e.g., Sex and Diabetes).

 Heatmaps: To visualize correlations between features and detect multicollinearity.

4. Multivariate Analysis
Explore interactions between multiple features and the target variable:

Analysis:

  Use logistic regression or decision trees to identify significant predictors.

  Analyze feature importance using machine learning models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.

Visualisations:

  Pair plots: To observe relationships between multiple numerical features at once.

  Parallel coordinate plots: For exploring patterns among individuals with heart disease.

5. Predictive Modelling
To predict heart disease and validate hypotheses:

Analysis:

  Use classification models like logistic regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.

  Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

Visualisations:

  ROC curve: To assess the performance of classification models.

Feature importance charts: To highlight which predictors contribute most to heart disease risk.

6. Advanced Visualisations
To create engaging and informative visuals:

  Decision Tree Diagram: To show pathways to heart failure based on predictors like Smoking and High_BP.

  Clustering Plots (using PCA or t-SNE): To group individuals based on similar risk factor patterns.
